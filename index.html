                <tspan class="underline">Functioning of Government:</tspan> Does the government work transparently? <br/> 
                <tspan class="underline">Political Participation:</tspan> How far are the people included into democratic elections and institutions?<br/> 
                <tspan class="underline">Political Culture:</tspan> How democratic do the people perceive their country?<br/> 
                <tspan class="underline">Civil Liberties:</tspan> How free are the country's people to consume media, hold protests or practice religion?<br/>
                Observe how differently pronounced the indicators are for Norway and Singapur. Each countries radar chart is included in its representation in the matrix.
